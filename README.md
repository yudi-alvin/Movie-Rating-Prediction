# Movie-Rating-Prediction
This project is related to the MovieLens Project of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course. 
The present report start with a general idea of the project and by representing its objectives.
Then the given dataset will be prepared and setup. An exploratory data analysis is carried out in order to develop a machine learning 
algorithm that could predict movie ratings until a final model.
Results will be explained. Finally the report ends with some concluding remarks.


## Introduction

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas, and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services
like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms 
such as Facebook and Twitter. In our project, we will use ratings that users have given to the movies to make specific recommendations. 

Recommendation systems are one of the most used models in machine learning algorithms. 
For this project we will focus on create an accurate movie rating prediction, which can be use for movie recommendation system, using the 10M version of MovieLens dataset, 
collected by GroupLens Research.
